## CSS Transforms  

1. Transform allows developers a new way to manipulate, position, alter, and display elements.  
2. Example: `transform: rotate(25deg) scale(.75);` could be used on a website to make a "button" (or any clickable event listener) more apparent and interactive!  

## CSS Transitions and Animations  

1. A transition allows developers to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change (ie: hover, focus, active, targeted) occurs.  
2. Transitions tend to occur on static elements. If we want to move an element, we can use animation to move that element within its "box"  

## 8 Simple CSS3 Transitions that will wow your users  

1. Some benefits of using CSS transtitions on websites: make it more appealing, eye catching, and memorable. It can also make the webpage easier to navigate (using transitions on hover).
2. I really enjoy CSS. If I pursue web development over game design, CSS will be exceedingly important to syle a page that draws a user in. If I pursue game design, then I can take what I have learned of CSS and apply it to the code necessary for game animation.  

## Things I want to konw more about  

- How are game environments normally animated?  
- How are apps normally animated?
