# State and Props  

## React Lifecycle  

1. Based on the diagram, Render happens first.  

2. The very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React is Mounting.  

3. constructor, render, React Updates, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount  

4. componentDidMount is a method that is used when you need to load anything using a network request or initilize the DOM [Meduim.com](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093)  

## React State Vs Props  

1. Pass in initial data, something to display to a user (ie: title, subtitle)  

2. props - data passed into a component, handled outside of a component. state - data that is inside of a component, handled inside of a component  

3. When we change something is state, the application will be re-rendered.  

4. Information that needs to be or can be updated, especially by a user.
