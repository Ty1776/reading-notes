## Code 102 Markdown reflection

Markdown is a very simple way of building a website to communicate information. Markdown uses a series of symbols as syntax to achieve effects such as **BOLD** or *Italics* or a ***combination*** rather than using code such as HTML, CSS, or Javascript.  
Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript allow your webpage to come alive and feel more professional. However, this reflection is on Markdown.  
To use Headings in Markdown, you use the # followed by a space. IE "# Heading 1" (But without the quotes.)  
Similar procedure is used to achieve different effects.
