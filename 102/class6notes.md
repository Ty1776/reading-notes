### How/Where to write JS  

- You can use a standard text editor to write it, however using a code editor will be easier and better with the added features you gain in the code editor.  
- You can either embed JS directly into your HTML file, o you can add a line to your HTML that will link to your JS file. (In most cases, you want to link to your external JS file)  
- JS is/can be used for website pop-ups.
